## Properties

### auto.offset.reset:

In `application.properties` we used  `spring.kafka.consumer.auto-offset-reset=latest`.


- latest: The consumer will start reading only new messages that arrive after it starts (this is often the default).
- earliest: The consumer will start reading from the very beginning of the log for that partition â€“ consuming all available messages that haven't been deleted by the retention policy.
- none: If no previous offset is found, an exception will be thrown to the consumer.
